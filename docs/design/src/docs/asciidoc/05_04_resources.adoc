| Service | Type | Value | Impact of load

| Logproxy Service | Memory    | 512 MB | Not expected to go beyond provisioned as load is very less.
| Logproxy Service | Disk      | 1 GB   | Not expected to grow as local disk storage is not used
| Logproxy Service | Instances | 1      | Load is expected to be more as this service is used by apps oftnely . Would need another instance if Active-Active HA is desired.
